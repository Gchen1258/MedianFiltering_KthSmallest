# Median Filtering Using KthSmallest and Median Order Statistics
Implementation of KthSmallest Algorithm and Linear Time Median Order to filter an image

Implementation of Order Statistics Algorithms of O(n) and O(nlgn) time. The program runs and displays the running
time for the implementations on a randomly initialized array of size n of range 0 to N.

Part 2 uses the two algorithms to apply a Mean Filter to an image and prints out the image.
